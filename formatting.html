  <h2>Dummy Text</h2> 
  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <b>typesetting industry</b>. <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> has been the industry's <strong>standard dummy </strong>text ever since the <sup>x5</sup>, when an unknown printer took a <i>galley</i> of type and <em>scrambled</em> it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <del>typesetting</del>, remaining <mark>Essentially</mark>s unchanged. It was popularised in the <sub>x5</sub> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
